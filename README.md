My website v0.1.0

This is my first attempt of building my own website. Just wanted to see if I can learn something new during the covid-19 lockdown.
I'd appreciate any constructive feedback. If possible, please guide me on what I should learn next and point me in the right direction.

I would love to obtain the skills and knowledge to become a full-stack developer!

Thanks for checking out my repo!
